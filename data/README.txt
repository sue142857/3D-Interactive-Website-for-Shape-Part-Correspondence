This folder contains 5 sets of well segmented man-made 
objects. These objects were selected from a larger dataset 
and each part in each object was manually labeled by a 
user following the labels found in the 'labels.json' files.

The labels for each part are stored in meta tags inside each
'.xml' shape file. The shape files include the parametric 
abstractions and surfaces for each part. Group and contact 
relations are also stored in the same file.
