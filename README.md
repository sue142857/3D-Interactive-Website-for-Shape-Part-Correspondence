# Intro for the Project
- Designed to study how users perform two computer graphics tasks: 3D shape part labeling and matching
- Provided real-time interactive operations (rotate/scale/select/label/match) on shape parts using JavaScript, three.js and WebGL
- Implemented frontend with HTML5, PHP, JavaScript and jQuery; Styled with CSS; Interacted with MySQL database using AJAX
- Hosted the website on Microsoft Azure; Managed cloud database and analyzed results

# Intro for Users
Dear users, welcome to our user study!

In this study, we are looking to study how humans correspond objects, which are from the same class but can be very structurally different.
The following is the process and some useful information for our user study:
1.	Visit the introduction page: http://drtopouserstudy.azurewebsites.net/drtopo_userstudy/. You will get some information about the purpose of our user study, what tasks to be done.  And you can also watch an introduction video, which shows an example of how to do labeling/matching tasks. You will be asked to label 15 shapes and match 20 shape pairs. Before starting the tasks, please specify a username.

2.	You can check the operations in the video here:
- View your progress in the main hint.
- Rotate shapes : press left mouse button and drag 
- Zoom and shrink shapes : roll the mouse scroll wheel 
- Select parts: double click on parts
- Label parts: select parts then click on a coarse label 
- Match parts:  select parts from two shapes then double click background
- Delete matches: select parts from one shapes then double click background
- Save result: click save button

3.	The following suggestions will help you to complete your tasks better and faster:
- If you think some initial assignments / correspondences seem good, you do not have to change them.
- In the labeling task, if you think there is no label provided for some parts, then assign “no label” to them. Repeat selection and assignment until all parts are considered in this task.
- In the matching task, repeat selection and matching but some parts can be left unmatched.
